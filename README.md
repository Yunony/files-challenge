My Dear TA, 

Here is a warm and positive message from me to you regarding the first assignment. I am pretty sure that you were growing up with "Harry Potter" series and hope that you liked them :) I definitely did and have received "Hermione" nickname in middle school. Now I know that it was for good. 

Best regards, 
witch Yuliya
